#### Ducks and Design Patterns Galore!

This is a learning repo, where I am following the exercises laid out in [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426984025&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+design+patterns).

The first exercise focuses on the following:

1. Take the parts that vary and isolate them from the parts that don't
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation
